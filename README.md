### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gaia Vallarino (she/her), a junior researcher at the Institute of Earth Observation of EURAC Research. I hold a M.Sc. in Geoinformatics Engineering :earth_africa::artificial_satellite: from Politecnico di Milano, and have been working on my Master's thesis at the University of Bonn, Germany. 

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

I'm a geoinformatics engineer with a strong interest in:
- Remote Sensing and Earth Observation :earth_africa::artificial_satellite:
- Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning :desktop_computer:
- GIS :world_map:
- Climate Change and Science. :earth_africa::recycle:

I love travelling and learning new languages. If I'm not doing either, I'm spending my time gardening :seedling:	:evergreen_tree:, playing videogames :video_game: or reading :open_book:.

The journey has been since an exciting one, and I'm yearning to find new opportunities to learn, collaborate, and create.

## Projects

I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to explore new concepts. Here are a few noteworthy projects:

- **[Thematic Classification](https://github.com/Koren96/ThematicClassification):** QGIS plugin for the Thematic Classification of satellite imagery. Developed in **Python**, using libraries such as scikit-learn and gdal. Created for the exam "*Geoinformatics Project*", the project earned the maximum grade (**30 cum laude**). 

- **[CocoCumbi](https://github.com/gaiavallarino/CocoCumbi):** Web-based software that allows for forest census and tree analysis. **Front-End** built with *HTML, CSS, JavaScript*. **Back-End** built in *Python*. **Database** used *PostGreSQL* and *PostGIS*. Created for the exam "*Software Engineering for Geoinformatics*", it scored the maximum grade (**30 cum laude**).

- **[Landslide Susceptibility](https://github.com/Rkomi98/Landslide):** Analysis of the landslide susceptibility of the area near Como and its Lake. The main analysis was done using *statistical tools* and *remote sensing indices* on **QGIS**. The results were shown on a **WebGIS** created with *HTML, CSS, and JS*, and the map was loaded on the **WebGIS** with the help of *PostGreSQL, GeoServer, and OpenLayers*.
